by reading theory I learnt how I can download something from the server
scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:sshkey.private .         
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: 
sshkey.private   (downloaded) 100%

after that to login to level 14 we used 
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
but it said that it is too open.. 
on chat gpt it gave me some commands and I used those spells
 as i was doing all of this on windows so 

cp /mnt/c/Users/LENOVO/sshkey.private ~/
chmod 600 ~/sshkey.private
ssh -i ~/sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and it logged me in..
