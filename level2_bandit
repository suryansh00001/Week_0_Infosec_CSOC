same login as previous level,
ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and then putting password from previous level ..

we can't directly read the file using cat , it gives..

bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces in this filename
cat: spaces: No such file or directory
cat: in: No such file or directory
cat: this: No such file or directory
cat: filename: No such file or directory

so we can use the same trick as previous level
cat ./spaces in the this filename
and we got the password again
