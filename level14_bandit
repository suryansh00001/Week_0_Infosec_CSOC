to loggin you can visit the previous problem page
..

and the hint of previous problem it was given that the path of the password is /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
so we can simple cat
bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS

and then we can login to next level by reading the instruction of this level
it states that we have to submit it to localhost with port = 30000

as intructed , I did
bandit14@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30000
MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS
Correct!
