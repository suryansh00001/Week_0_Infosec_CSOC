for login in the level1 
command is ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and then we just put our password from the previous level and boom!! we are logged in

it doesnt return anything

so we have to use the path of that file to read that file 
so we do cat ./-
and the password found was 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
